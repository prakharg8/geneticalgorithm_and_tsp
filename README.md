# geneticalgorithm_and_tsp
Compares nearest neighbor algorithm with genetic algorithm to find a solution for TSP. The implementation is in c++ and sfml.
The comparision is shown between three algorithms: nearest neighbor, genetic algorithm and genetic algorithm to improve the solution given by nearest neighbor algorithm.
